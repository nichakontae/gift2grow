# What is Gift2Grow?
An app to facilitate the donation of student uniforms and learning materials. What sets us apart from other donation apps is that we partner directly with schools to receive information about their specific donation requirements. This allows us to provide our app users with targeted information on the schools and students who are in need of these donated items.
